##### Last updated: October 13, 2014.

What data does Olympia make available to the public? How do we find it? How does Olympia compare to other cities in towns in Washington and across the country?

Using the [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/) as a guide, we'll be exploring what Olympia has available and how you can access and use the data. In cases where the data is not available, we'll be making public record requests for that data and making it available on the website of _The Percival_.

## The data

### Asset Disclosure

Asset disclosure for the city of Olympia _may_ be available from the [Public Disclosure Commission](http://www.pdc.wa.gov/). They collect [Personal Affairs Statements](http://www.pdc.wa.gov/public/personalfinancialaffairs.aspx), though it isn't clear if these statements are collected for the elected officials in each municipality & county, or just for state elected officials and executive state officers.
