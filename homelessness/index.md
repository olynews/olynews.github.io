"Panhandling Definition" - "Panhandling" is any solicitation made in person, requesting an immediate donation of money or other thing of value. Purchase of an item for an amount far exceeding its value, under circumstances where a reasonable person would understand that the purchase is, in substance, a donation, is a donation for the purpose of this chapter. Offers to work for food or other compensation, under circumstances where a reasonable person would understand that the compensation given is, in substance, a donation, is also a donation for the purposes of this chapter.

In 2005, the Washington State Legislature passed [The Homeless Housing and Assistance Act](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=43.185c). Along with requiring counties to do a census of the people who are homeless in their counties and report back to the legislature every year about how they’re doing, each county is required to do an annual "Point in Time Census" (or Homeless Census) and give that data back to the Washington State Department of Commerce.

The intent of this law was to (it’s either reduce homelessness by 50% or eliminate homelessness. Need to find this out). Now, in 2014, we are nowhere close to reaching that original goal.

**How is homelessness defined?**

	For the purpose of this article, it’s someone "living outside or in a building not meant for human habitation or which they have no legal right to occupy, in an emergency shelter, or in a temporary housing program which may include a transitional and supportive housing program if habitation time limits exist." This is the Washington State definition.

	In general, though, [It varies a bit](http://www.nhchc.org/faq/official-definition-homelessness/)[.](http://www.nhchc.org/faq/official-definition-homelessness/)

	Since 2005, as part of The Homeless Housing and Assistance Act, every county in Washington State has to do an annual Point in Time Census (or "Homeless Census") and report back to the Washington State Department of Commerce how many people they counted. The Homeless Census has two counts: the state count of 599 people (and what we will be focused on) and what they call the “full count.” Thurston County includes two more groups of people in their full-count for purposes of shelter and social services: those in jail and medical institutions who will be homeless when they are released and people living with family and friends (think: couch surfing). The “full count” (people who are included in the two above groups) is 926 versus the state count of 599.

	[image of county full count versus state count]

	One last thing about the census: it’s assumed that these numbers is an undercount. A lot of people in rural areas who are homeless live off the grid and some people, didn’t participate.

**Homelessness is a humanitarian and an economic issue. **

First the economic factors. It’s just expensive to have people living on the street. There are the costs of emergency room visits, treating other medical and psychiatric issues, the salaries of law enforcement to deal with things like preventing people from sleeping on the sidewalk or loitering.

On top of that, the chronically homeless (defined as someone who has been homeless for over a year or if they have been homeless 4 or more times over the course of a year), [generally use up a lot more public resources than other demographics who are homeless.](http://www.endhomelessness.org/library/entry/fact-sheet-chronic-homelessness)

The humanitarian issue is more pressing. Other than

Youth (241 of the census sample): in a 2001 study ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11769208](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11769208)), homeless youth are more likely to consider suicide, be sexually assaulted, and use sex in trade for something (cite this).

**Hey. Let’s talk about Housing First.**

**	**

	Housing First programs differ depending on who is implementing it and the population it targets, but it is [providing someone who is homeless permanent (and, sometimes supervised) shelter and taking care of other services after](http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/housing_first)wards. The idea is: it is easier to help someone once their basic needs are met. If someone has shelter, a place to eat, then it is easier for someone to access to other care. Then, i[f someone has permanent housing, it is easier to provide them with social services.](http://www.endhomelessness.org/library/entry/what-is-housing-first)

	[This ends up saving a huge amount of money](http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764096/its-three-times-cheaper-to-give-housing-to-the-homeless-than-to-keep), even if it is relatively expensive to start up.

**What’s being done****?**

	We’re not going to reach the goal of reducing homelessness in Olympia by (???) by next year. However, both locally and nationally, the amount of people who are homeless appears to be going down. [Part of it is that the economy is doing better now than it was 4 years ago when the population who were homeless was at its high of 976 back in 2010.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/the-astonishing-decline-of-homelessness-in-america/279050/) A better economy means more jobs and money to go around.

	A large part of it, as The National Association to End Homelessness (NAEH) has pointed out in [their](http://www.endhomelessness.org/library/entry/state-of-homelessness-in-america-2011) [last](http://www.endhomelessness.org/library/entry/the-state-of-homelessness-2014) [three](http://www.endhomelessness.org/library/entry/the-state-of-homelessness-2013) State of the Homeless reports, the federal government played a large part in the decline.

	NAEH’s 2014 State of the Homeless Report points out:

	"Targeted federal funding to end homelessness is at its highest level in history—HUD’s [The Department of Housing and Urban Development] homeless assistance grants were funded at $2.1 billion and HUD received $75 million for approximately 10,000 new joint HUD-VA supportive housing (HUD-VASH) vouchers targeted toward chronically homeless veterans. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received $300 million in funding for rapid re-housing and homelessness prevention for veterans in the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program and $278 million for the HUD-VASH program in FY 2014."

On a local level: there’s a long list of organizations helping the homeless population in Olympia and [is currently being compiled here on OlyWiki.](http://localwiki.net/oly/Homelessness) Last year The Homeless Census reported 212 beds and 149 households available in a temporary capacity in 2013 and 232 beds and 123 households available in a "transitional capacity" (where someone could stay for up to 20 years).

* [Quixote Village](http://quixotevillage.com/history/) got national attention last year for making a community of micro-houses to house 30 adults who were previously homeless. [link to a bunch of different news attention on Quixote Village]

* Community Youth Services (CYS), [from their 2013 annual report,](http://www.communityyouthservices.org/pdf/Development/2013%20Annual%20Report.pdf) has 107 young adults in transitional housing, served 330 12-17 year old who have run away, and provided street outreach to 764 youth who were "homeless, vulnerable, or in imminent crisis."

* [SafePlace](http://www.safeplaceolympia.org/) gives temporary shelter specifically to victims of domestic violence and is the only organization in Olympia to do so. They provide 28 beds and 10 households, according to the 2014 Homeless Census.

Temporary Shelter (up to 90 days)

* Salvation Army, 42 beds and 42 households. 25/25 for cold weather

	In August 2013, Stephen Lurie of The Atlantic, brings up the point:

"The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a leader in homelessness service and research,[ estimates](http://b.3cdn.net/naeh/bb34a7e4cd84ee985c_3vm6r7cjh.pdf) a 17% decrease in total homelessness from 2005 to 2012. As a refresher: this covers a period when unemployment[ doubled](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) (2007-2010) and foreclosure proceedings[ quadrupled](http://www.realtytrac.com/images/reportimages/foreclosure_starts_completions_june_2013.jpg) (2005-2009)."

"the control of homelessness, in spite of countervailing forces, can be traced directly to Washington"



* Look into crime or lack of stuff correlated/related to homelessness

* Find that one guy’s statistic about homeless minors being solicited for sex within 24 hours of being homeless.

* Those people who are not participating in the economy.

* Effects on panhandling on downtown businesses

* Helping the marginalized population of Olympia
